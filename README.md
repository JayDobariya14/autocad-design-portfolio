# AutoCAD Design Portfolio

Welcome to my AutoCAD Design Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of basic AutoCAD designs created during my first semester as part of a degree course. These designs are intended to serve as starting points for learners and showcase fundamental skills in CAD drafting.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a variety of basic AutoCAD designs that I created during my introductory course. These designs cover essential techniques and concepts in CAD drafting, such as:

- Drawing basic shapes and objects
- Applying dimensions and annotations
- Layer management
- Understanding coordinate systems

While these designs are basic, they provide a foundation for building more complex projects and exploring advanced features of AutoCAD.

## Usage

To view or use these designs, you will need AutoCAD software installed on your computer. Each design file is provided in [format: DWG, DXF, etc.] format for compatibility.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JayDobariya14/autocad-design-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the design folder and open the .dwg files using AutoCAD.

3. Explore and analyze the designs to understand the basic principles of CAD drafting showcased in each file.
